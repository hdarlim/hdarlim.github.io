## Welcome to my GitHub page

Hello, I'm Henrique Darlim.  
You can use the links below to access my projects.

### Deleuze tribute page

A [tribute page](https://hdarlim.github.io/deleuze/) to the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, made as a FreeCodeCamp project to obtain my certificate in [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

### My digital garden

I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a project by [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0), to ease the process of digital gardening. I'm still learning how to use it properly — but maybe it's meant to be an everlasting learning movement. You can take a look at it [here](https://hdarlim.github.io/quartz/).

### caravinalia

My [“personal” blog](https://caravinalia.wordpress.com/) containing texts, translations and notes. I stopped writing for it but I plan to return as soon as I find how to organize it better.

For now that's it!
